We intend to analyze differences among Lasso, Elastic Net, and Partial Least Sqaure regressions with given [dataset](https://github.com/Minghe4419/DataScience-II/blob/cb5f156e1201a9ec6983c5d9788a2b9a01bbb5a2/homeworks/hw1/data/housing_training.csv).

We also contrast the prediction performance between R packges `glmnet` and `caret` w/ Lasso Regression as an example.
